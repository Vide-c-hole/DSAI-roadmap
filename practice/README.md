# Data Science Practice Lab

> **Workflow**: You write code → Claude Code runs/debugs → You learn why

## How This Works

1. **Pick a concept** from your course or interview prep list
2. **Read the exercise** in the relevant folder
3. **Write your solution** in the `_my_solution.py` or `_my_solution.sql` file
4. **Run with Claude Code**: "Run my solution and tell me what's wrong"
5. **Iterate** until you understand it

## Interview Question Bank

Common data science interview patterns:

1. **SQL**: "Find the second highest salary"
2. **Pandas**: "Clean this messy dataset"
3. **Stats**: "Explain p-value in simple terms"
4. **ML**: "How do you handle imbalanced classes?"
5. **Case**: "How would you reduce customer churn?"

See `interview-prep/` for practice problems.
